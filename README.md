## 'Emerging Cultures of Data Science Ethics in the Academy and Industry'

Welcome to the team! At a high level, this project sets out to assess the state, structure, and substance of data ethics in both educational and industry contexts. In the educational context, the project will pair analysis of extant syllabi and curricula with qualitative assessments of data science programs to develop an empirical account of data ethics education as it currently exists. In comparing approaches across courses and programs, the project will: 
1. Describe the varied perspectives on data science ethics education
2. Establish where there is agreement about the purpose and substance of data science ethics, and 
3. Identify areas of active and ongoing debate. 

This summer, your job as an RA will be to help collect data on relevant courses from our university sample list. This will be done by creating a collection of python scripts that crawl university rosters and extract courses we're interested in. The parameters for these are specified in the [example course catalog crawler](example_course_catalog_crawler.ipynb), which serves as an introductory tutorial. 

### Prerequisites
* [Python (3.7 preferred)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Knowledge of web programming, including basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Knowledge of web scraping ([this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/) is particularly helpful as a starting point)
* Knowledge of [NLP text preprocessing](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/04/text-preprocessing-nlp-machine-learning.html)
* Knowledge of [Regular Expressions](https://regexone.com/)

### Getting Set Up
1. Clone this repository on GitHub using `git clone <url>`
2. Work through the [example course catalog crawler](example_course_catalog_crawler.ipynb)
3. Reproduce the crawler for all universities in the sample list
