# Problems for discussion:

1. Keyword v.s. Title search:
    - Example: Columbia
    - SOLUTION: Filter keywords on titles again
2. Only Fall 2019, Spring 2019, and Summer 2019 Schedule are available:
    - Example: Columbia
    - SOLUTION: Only do 2019
3. Course catalog v.s. course schedule
    - SOLUTION: Choose course schedule (courses are actively teaching)
4. Schools that are closing/closed and schools that don't have the specified campus - what do we do with them?
5. Terms vs Years - What do we do for schools that don't specify terms in the catalog?
6. Do we search both undergraduate and graduate courses?
7. Pdf archived catalogs - do we ignore schoold that only have pdf catalogs and no HTML pages?
8. No courses that have combined key words, only those with 'secur' & 'privac' left
