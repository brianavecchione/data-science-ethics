# Problems for discussion:

1. Keyword v.s. Title search:
    - Example: Columbia
    - SOLUTION: Filter keywords on titles again
2. Only Fall 2019, Spring 2019, and Summer 2019 Schedule are available:
    - Example: Columbia
    - SOLUTION: Only do 2019
3. Course catalog v.s. course schedule
    - SOLUTION: Choose course schedule (courses are actively teaching)
4. Schools that are closing/closed and schools that don't have the specified campus
5. Terms vs Years
6. Do we search both undergraduate and graduate courses
7. Pdf archived catalogs
8. No courses that have combined key words, only those with 'secur' & 'privac' left
